# Domain Modeling

Actively build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design. This is the *active* discipline: challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and decisions down the moment they crystallise. (Merely *reading* `.agents/CONTEXT.md` for vocabulary is not this skill: that's a one-line habit any skill can do. This skill is for when you're changing the model, not just consuming it.)

## File structure

The glossary lives in this repo under `.agents/`. ADRs do not: they live in the central docs repo named in `.agents/config/shoddyguard-domain.md`. Read that file before writing anything.

Most repos have a single context:

```
/
├── .agents/
│   └── CONTEXT.md
└── src/
```

If `.agents/CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives:

```
/
├── .agents/
│   ├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
│   └── context/
│       ├── ordering.md
│       └── billing.md
└── src/
```

Glossaries stay under `.agents/` even in a multi-context repo. Never write one into `src/`, and never write anything into `docs/`: that's human-owned.

Create files lazily: only when you have something to write. If no glossary exists, create one when the first term is resolved.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in the glossary, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y. Which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account': do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible. Which is right?"

### Update the glossary inline

When a term is resolved, update `.agents/CONTEXT.md` right there. Don't batch these up: capture them as they happen. Use the format in [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](./CONTEXT-FORMAT.md).

The glossary should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat it as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions. It is a glossary and nothing else.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse**: the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context**: a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off**: there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Use the format in [ADR-FORMAT.md](./ADR-FORMAT.md).
